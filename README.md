# Counter

## Introduction
Here I decided to just make a simple number counter that changed to green when the value is positive and red when the value is negative. I also added a button to change between light and night mode.

## Techologies
<li><ul>HTML</ul></li>
<li><ul>CSS</ul></li>
<li><ul>Javascript</ul></li>

## Future Development
With the night mode the general back ground toggles between light and night, however, I did not make it that the container changes colour. To make the whole web app more fluid adding a properties that will change it aswell.
